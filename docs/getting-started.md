## Contributing to the Documentation
First install the necessary packages to use mkdoc
```bash
pip install -e .[docs]
```
Afterwards you can add or modify the contents of the docs folder to create or change the current documentation.

If you would like to see the changes made to the document locally use
```bash
mkdocs serve

mkdocs gh-deploy # Only run this when everything is finalized
# because this pushes the documentation to the website
```
