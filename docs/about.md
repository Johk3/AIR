# About AIR Plugin

## What is AIR Plugin?

The **AIR Plugin** is an **interactive cell segmentation tool** for Napari, allowing users to control image analysis using **voice commands**. With AIR, biologists can zoom, highlight areas, adjust contrast, and mark cells simply by speaking, making image processing more intuitive and efficient.

## Vision

- Making complex image filtering accessible through **voice commands**.
- Enhancing **productivity** for researchers with **AI-driven automation**.
- Providing an **open-source, community-driven tool** for image segmentation.

## Features

- **Voice-controlled image filtering**
- **AI-assisted interaction**
- **Multiple image enhancement techniques**
- **Seamless integration with Napari**
