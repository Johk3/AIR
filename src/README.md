## What is src?
src contains all of the files(components) that the main.py can execute

## But what if I am working on SST or something else and I dont want to run main.py because it has someone elses code in it and I dont want to change it?
If you want to run the component you made locally you can just run it the file directly here in src if you add if __name__ = "__main__": etc...

## Should I make a new requirements.txt here?
No. Put all of the dependencies any of your components might have in the root directory requirements.txt.
